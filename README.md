# Python List Cryptography Project

## Description
This project demonstrates a cryptography system using Python lists. It focuses on creating basic encryption and decryption methods with list manipulation techniques.

## Ciphering Methods
The project implements several ciphering methods, including:
- **Caesar Cipher**: Shifts letters in the alphabet by a specified number.
- **Substitution Cipher**: Replaces each letter with another according to a predefined mapping.
- **Vigen√®re Cipher**: Uses a keyword to shift letters in a cyclic manner.
- **Transposition Cipher**: Reorganizes the order of letters in the text.

## Features
- Implement encryption and decryption algorithms using Python lists.
- Examples provided for each cipher method.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CooperDavis00/Cprytography-Project.git
